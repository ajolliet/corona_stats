### U.S. COVID-19 Tracker

corona_stats is a little Python project put together to report on daily COVID-19 case numbers for each of the U.S. states and territories.

The program leverages the COVID Tracking Project's API, which can be found at: https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily.

I created this project to familiarize myself with ingesting and working with JSON data as well as the requests module.
